Following along with The Ray Tracer Challenge  Buck, Jamis.  Pragmatic Bookshelf. Kindle Edition. 

## Overview

Thanks to Peter Shirley for reviving my latent interest in Ray Tracing in "One weekend".  Seeing the description of this book where I actually WRITE the code, I thought I'd give it a go and see how far it takes me.

##  Language and environment.

C++, of course, 'cause it's "what I do."  Ditto for Vim and Make on my trusty Macbook Air.  
Instead of Cucumber, I use Googletest, largely because its roots are in CppUnit, which I have
used, and because I could find no real help getting started with Cucumber.  The Gherkin
used in the text will gguide my Googletests.
