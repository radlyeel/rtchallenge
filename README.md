Following along with The Ray Tracer Challenge  Buck, Jamis.  Pragmatic Bookshelf. Kindle Edition.

Thanks to Peter Shirley for reviving my latent interest in Ray Tracing in "One weekend".  Seeing the description of this book where I actually WRITE the code, I thought I'd give it a go and see how far it takes me.

##  Language and environment.

C++, of course, 'cause it's "what I do."  Ditto for Vim and Make on my trusty Macbook Air.
